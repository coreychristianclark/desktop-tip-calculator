# Desktop Tip Calculator

Tip Calculator, 
Third Project, 
7/25/2023

For this project, I wanted to build something practical – a useful tool people could benefit from very frequently. I’ve had more than enough encounters of having to do these calculations by hand, so I created a tool to do it all for me.

The calculator is rather straightforward. Just make sure you fill out each field completely. When filling out ‘Divide By’, it is required that you enter a minimum of ‘1’.

At the bottom of the calculator, you will see ‘L’, ‘C’, and ‘R’ buttons (left, center, and right). These will determine the position of the calculator on your screen. It just allows for more options depending on how users like to set up their windows.
